"""
Inheritance and polymorphism are the core concepts of OOP that enable efficient and consistent
code reuse. Learn how to inherit from a class, customize and redefine methods, and review the 
differences between class-level data and instance-level data.

  - Inheritance: extending functionality of existing code
  - Polymorphism : creating unified interface 
  - Encapsulation:  bundiling of data and methods
  
Why use class attributes? (global constants related to class ->)
  - min / max values for attributes
  - conmmonly used values / constants : e.g. pi for a circle class 
Class methods ?
  - already shared. Same code for every instance
  - can't use instance-level data
